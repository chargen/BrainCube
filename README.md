# BrainCube
BrainCube is a programming language based on manipulating pointers to a shared, 3D abstraction of a data store.

#### Why call it BrainCube?
The whole BrainCube language is based upon two core ideas:
 * The user may only use pointers to manipulate memory.   
     - This idea was influenced by the **brain**f\*\*k language, hence the "Brain" part of **Brain**Cube.
 * Behind the scenes, all memory is stored in a three dimensional data structure.  
     - If a normal array can be thought of as a line, then a 2D array could be thought of as a square,  
  and a 3D structure could be thought of as a **cube**, hence the "Cube"  part of Brain**Cube**.

#### Why aren't there any code examples?
Quick answer: I am still in the process of writing the language specification.

Long winded answer: The first language that I wrote, MindMeld, was only a very slight modification to brainf\*\*k that added a second pointer. I probably specced it in under 5 minutes, given how simple the modification was. However, dispite the simplicity of the language, I still made design choices I wasn't happy with further down the road.  
This time around, I am going to spend some time writing a detailed language specification, which will be available on [the wiki](https://github.com/quietsamurai98/BrainCube/wiki).
